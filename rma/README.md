# Cisco DNA Center Authentication guide

Return merchandise authorization (RMA) APIs simplify the workflow to replace a faulty device with an existing device with the same characteristics (model, platform, etc). Using this functionality, Cisco DNA Centers manages the configuration changes and all relevant logical tasks to replace the old device with the new one, minimizing human error and speeding up the recovery process

This script triggers the RMA workflow.

## Functions

The [functions](./rma-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.
