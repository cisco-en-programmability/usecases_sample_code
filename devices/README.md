# Cisco DNA Center Devices guide

## Devices API

Cisco DNA Center has information of the devices that are part of the network. The API allows you to query that information to use it for inventory, more operations within DNA Center or as a source of truth of your network.

These scripts retrieve information about the network devices on Cisco DNA Center.

## Functions

The [functions](./devices-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.

## SDK

The [SDK](./devices-sdk.py) uses [Cisco DNA Center Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/dnacentersdk/) to simplify the interaction with the API.
