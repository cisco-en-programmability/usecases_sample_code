# Cisco DNA Center guides

This repository has examples for different use cases using Cisco DNA Center APIs. All of the examples have a functions file that uses the python _requests_ library and some also show how to achieve the same outcome with the [Cisco DNA Center Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/dnacentersdk/).

To use any of the examples, it is needed for the developer to change the BASE_URL, USERNAME and PASSWORD variables.
