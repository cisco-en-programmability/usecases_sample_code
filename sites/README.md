# Cisco DNA Center Authentication guide

## Sites API

Site API allows the user to create a hierarchy on its network with area, buildings and floors, thus replicating the physical world infrastructure and grouping devices on Cisco DNA Center like they are setup in the real world.

Once the hierarchy is created and has devices assigned to it, it is possible to use the Site API to query the site health.

This script creates and retrieves sites information.

## Functions

The [functions](./sites-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.
