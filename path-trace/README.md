# Cisco DNA Center Path Trace guide

Path trace is the feature in Cisco DNA Center that allows you to execute a trace between two devices in your network. It is possible to get device and interface statistics, QoS details and/or ACLs traces and do it using different ports and protocols.

It can be used to troubleshoot network problems like packet loss, traffic not reaching its destination because of ACLs or routing issues.

## Functions

The [functions](./path-trace-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.
