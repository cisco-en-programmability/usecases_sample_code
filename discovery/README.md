# Cisco DNA Center Discovery guide

## Discovery API

Discovery API allows the user to execute a discovery of network devices on the infrastructure using different techniques like IP Range, CDP, etc. Also, it can be done with SNMP, SSH, NETCONF, amongst others.

Leveraging Discovery API, the user can quickly get its devices into Cisco DNA Center and perform operations related to them.

This script triggers a network discovery and assigns the devices to a site.

## Functions

The [functions](./discovery-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.
