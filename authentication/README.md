# Cisco DNA Center Authentication guide

These scripts will return an authorization token for the user to use in subsequent requests.

The token is used to authorize to Cisco DNA Center API and be able to perform actions based on that authorization.

## Functions

The [functions](./authentication-functions.py) file uses python requests library to interact with the API.

## SDK

The [SDK](./authentication-sdk.py) uses [Cisco DNA Center Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/dnacentersdk/) to simplify the interaction with the API.
